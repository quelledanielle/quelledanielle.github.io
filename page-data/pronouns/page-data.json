My teachers convinced me that singular they was an incorrect grammar construct. It was hard for me to accept until I learned more about how language changes over time, and until one of my close friends began using they/them pronouns.</p>\n<p>In Spring 2018, I met other non-binary and trans folks at the <a href=\"https://recurse.com\">Recurse Center</a>, who asked if I wanted them to try referring to me with they/them pronouns. Throughout my life I felt disconnected to the culture and assumptions around being a girl or woman, so shifting away from feminine pronouns felt right.</p>\n<p>My partner, circles of friends, and people who work with me all refer to me with they/them pronouns. It sticks out when people don’t use them, and it causes me to overthink how I present myself publicly. Please consider she/her pronouns deprecated — my pronouns are they/them.</p>\n<p>I’m not offended when mistakes are made, but it’s unlikely that I’ll correct anyone. I don’t need people to police others’ language on my behalf, but I appreciate the gentle reminders people have given each other to make my life a little easier. It’s totally okay to mess up while you’re getting used to it — catching yourself in the process still signals to me that you care. What makes me uncomfortable is prolonged usage of the wrong pronouns.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you!</em></p>","excerpt":"🗣 they/them/their Examples D lives in Canada with their partner.
